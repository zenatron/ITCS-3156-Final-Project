## Abstract

This project uses machine learning to predict which products will become best sellers on an e-commerce platform. Starting with about 80,000 products, it applies two classification methods—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—to features like price, discount percentage, and product category. After handling missing data, standardizing numerical features, and encoding categories, the models are trained on 70% of the data, validated on 10%, and tested on 20%. Results show that the Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression, especially in identifying best sellers. Key factors linked to best-selling products include lower prices (under $25), higher discounts (over 15%), and certain categories such as Home & Kitchen. These findings can help businesses understand consumer purchasing patterns, and can help sales platforms optimize their methods.
